## üåç Country Capitals Quiz using PostgreSQL

This program demonstrates the use of **PostgreSQL** and **SQL** to connect and interact with a large country database. It is designed as a quiz that tests the user's knowledge of world capitals by checking the correctness of their input against the database records.

The data is sourced from an Excel sheet containing country-capital pairs, which is imported into a PostgreSQL table.

The table is queried in real-time to validate user responses.

This project showcases database integration, data handling, and simple user interaction through SQL queries.

Below is a preview of the Excel sheet and PostgreSQL table used in the program:
